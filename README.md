# ah-sample-plugin

I am a simple sample plugin for actionhero.  I don't do much, as I am just an example

- I will add the current time to all action responses via middleware
- I will create a new config file which is used to set a response message to all action responses
- I load in an action, `ahSampleAction` which will return `{message: ...}` to the client loaded from the config
